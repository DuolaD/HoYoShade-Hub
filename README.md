# HoYoShade Hub

> **HoYoShade Hub** is a brand-new GUI launcher developed for HoYoShade, based on the secondary development of Starward.
>
> The logo design of **HoYoShade Hub** was inspired by the logo of the well-known anti-censorship proxy core [Sing-Box](https://github.com/SagerNet/sing-box). This design aligns with the definition of "Hub" itself and represents our new vision for HoYoShade—
>
> Even if we can never obtain the freedom we deserve, we should never forget to fight for it.
>
> Enjoy the fleeting freedom we have fought for, for it is yours.

HoYoShade Hub is an open-source GUI launcher developed to address the shortcomings of the current Bat launcher for HoYoShade. It supports all miHoYo/HoYoverse game clients for Windows PC, including clients from Mainland China, BiliBili, Global, and other special distribution channels, as well as Public, Beta, Devkit, SDK, and Creator Test servers. The goal is to completely replace the existing Bat launcher for HoYoShade.

> [!NOTE]
> Please note that this project is still under development. Some text may not reflect the actual situation, and some features may not work as expected. Further logs/issues will be collected and fixed, or features may not yet be implemented in HoYoShade Hub. For details, please refer to the [GitHub Release](https://github.com/DuolaD/HoYoShade-Hub/releases) for the changelog.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have specific requirements for functionality/stability, we recommend using the old Bat launcher in the [HoYoShade repository](https://github.com/DuolaD/HoYoShade/).

> [!NOTE]
> This GUI launcher will replace the existing Bat launcher for HoYoShade once all features are fully developed. At that time, HoYoShade will only be usable with HoYoShade Hub as the launcher.
